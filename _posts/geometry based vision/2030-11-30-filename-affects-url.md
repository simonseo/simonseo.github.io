Filename affects the url. 

Even if I have an explicit title? Yes. unless I use the permalink option in the header. I won't use title headings for normal posts. Let's see how long the excerpt goes on for. This is a pretty long paragraph and I expect it should have been cut off by now. However, this is another sentence just in case.
