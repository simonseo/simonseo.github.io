The question that opens a course at CMU. Perhaps the only thing I can figure out perfectly in this course. 

<!-- excerpt_separator -->

The first paragraph is not indented. The second paragraph and onwards are indented.

This website theme was made by [patdryburgh](https://patdryburgh.com/). Photos below are mine though.

We have code highlighting

```py
# python
class Example:
    pass
```

And to produce a page like this we need the following folder structure:

```
_posts > whatever_folder_name > yyyy-mm-dd-projN.md
_posts > whatever_folder_name > data > whatever_local_files
```
where N is a number.

They only need a filename.
Permalink in the front-matter of post-title.md should be empty.
The date in the front-matter is what actually gets used.
