##1. Abstract
![as a child, have you ever wanted to be the main character of your favorite story?](https://i.imgur.com/ycRLHll.png)
<br/>
Recent advancements in generative models and LLMs, such as Stable Diffusion and ChatGPT, have ushered in a new wave of excitement for AI. We want to leverage this technology to enable applications that, up until recently, might have seemed like magic. We will focus on creating illustrations for a chosen story, where the main character(s) of the plot can be customized to the user’s liking. By using user input to inform the story’s title and characters, our system allows people to see themselves in the stories they read and to explore their own imagination. Our goal is to obtain the best results possible, which means leveraging pretrained foundation models as much as we can and exploring SOTA image editing methods for customization. The result will be a cohesive, compelling illustrated story where anyone can be the protagonist.

##1. Our Goals
Here are the goals of our project:

1) Generate the complete story from just a title.
2) Substitute one character in the story with a character of our choosing, such as replacing the wolf with our teammate's dog, 'Aspen'.
3) Ensure a consistent style across all scenes while achieving high-quality visualization.

<!--like the little red riding hood
And swap out a character with a character we actually know.
Like this chaing wolf to our teammate’s dog Aspen

##1. TuT Architecture

![diagram of pipeline](https://i.imgur.com/QGXdgQe.png "diagram of pipeline")

<!-- ![diagram of pipeline](https://i.imgur.com/P752ako.png "diagram of TuT pipeline") -->
We've created an end-to-end pipeline that generates custom illustrated storybooks. You provide a title and some character customization images to start with, and it produces the plot along with beautiful illustrations to tell a coherent story. 

There are three key modules:
1. Story generation with LLM 
2. Train text2image model on custom images for chosen character
3. Story illustration from generated prompts and custom text2image model

##1. Method

###1. Story Generation with LLM
![example of generated story caption and text2image prompt](https://i.imgur.com/qpOhloA.png)


The first module creates the text of the story. We use OpenAI's Chat Completion API (somewhat similar to ChatGPT) to generate a story from the title of a well-known story or a short description of a custom story. Along with the story, we also generate text2image prompts at this stage. We found that generating text2image prompts separately works better than using the story plot directly for image generation. We use the GPT 3.5 Turbo model which is available at no monetary cost and provides a simple web API. 

We first condition the chat completion model as a children's book storyteller. This is what we tell the system even before we ask it to generate stories:

```python
self.messages = [{
    "role": "system",
    "content": (
        "You are a storyteller who tells children's stories. "
        "You don't use pronouns. You are good at counting numbers. "
        "You will focus on getting the number of sentences correct. "
        "Be descriptive about appearance of character and background. "
        "Answer the following question."
    )
}]
completion = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=self.messages
)
chat_response = completion.choices[0].message.content
```

Note that on top of conditioning the model on its role, we encourage it to be accurate at counting the number of sentences and to be dscriptive about the physical appearance of the scene. More on this later.

Next, we output sentences that can be used as prompts in the text2image generation process.

```python
prompt = (
    f"Write a book of the story {title} with {custom_key} as the main character '{character.orig_name}' "
    f"with {self.num_sentences} pages, one sentence per page, and one illustration per page. "
    f"Provide a prompt for a speech-to-image system in square brackets to generate each illustration. "
    f"Show me a numbered list of exactly {self.num_sentences} sentences. "
    "As an example, for the story of Jack and the Beanstalk, you would generate: \n "
    "1. On a small farm, Jack lived with his mother in a small cottage [Generate an image of the cottage]. \n"
    "2. They were poor and had no food to eat, so his mother asked Jack to sell their cow [Generate an image of Jack leading the cow to a market]. \n"
    "3. On the way to the market, Jack met a strange old man who gave him magic beans in exchange for the cow [Generate an image of the old man and Jack exchanging the cow and magic beans]. \n"
)
```

We made sure to prioritize the structure of the language model's output, and even provided a specific template for it to follow. This was important in order to maintain consistency and standardization throughout the pipeline, since we needed to extract the captions and text2image prompts separately for the next steps.

###1. Train Text2Image with Custom Images

####1. Dataset
For customization, we prepare seed datasets with each of the authors and Aspen (the dog). We find that optimal results are achieved with 5-10 selfies taken from different angles and light settings.

####1. Comparing Dreambooth and Textual Inversion
In our project, we have tried two different approaches for generating images, namely Dreambooth [5] and Textual Inversion [2]. Dreambooth yielded better overall results, but at the cost of increased computational requirements. In contrast, Textual Inversion is much more lightweight and requires less computational resources.

####1. Dreambooth quality enhancement
Additionally, to further enhance the quality of the generated images produced by Dreambooth, we finetuned the text encoder and preserved priors by providing class images (ex. boy vs. Simon boy). Adding both these training tricked resulted in higher-quality images that are more visually appealing and more closely aligned with the intended style of our project.

####1. Effect of speed up techniques
To optimize the performance of our approach, we have utilized several speed-up techniques, including mixed precision, 8-bit Adam, and LoRA. These methods have enabled us to achieve faster image generation times and to process a bunch of data in a shoter amount of time.

###1. Story Illustration with Custom Text2Image

![](https://i.imgur.com/rN4eVJo.png)

####1. The comparison between different text2image models
We experimented with several different text2image models: Stable Diffusion (v1.5 and v2), Midjourney V5 (through paid API), and OpenJourney (public model trained on Midjourney images).

Midjourney V5 has a clear advantage over the other models and produces the most consistently beautiful and relevant images. Both Stable Diffusion and OpenJourney generate unwanted artifacts for more complex scenes and require many attempts for the handpicked outputs you see below:

![](https://i.imgur.com/SRf2YW1.jpg){:class="cropped-image"}

However, we cannot gain access to the Midjourney model for customization and use Stable Diffusion [4] and OpenJourney for our project.

####1. Handling page consistency
We want to ensure that the overall style of images in the storybook stays consistent. This could be approached in three ways (from easy to difficult). 

1. tell our text2image model to generate in a particular style, forcing consistency across pages 
2. generate each image and provide the first generated image or a user provided image as a reference style image, or 
3. train a style consistency loss over all of the images.

We were able to make the first idea work and created styles using prompt engineering of the text2image model. We append these as suffixes to our prompt.

##1. Limitations
We originally envisioned a web app where users can run TuT in real time to get customized results. However, the computational requirements make that really difficult as each model takes ~30 minutes for training and inference. 

Moreover, the results do not look as great as we would've hoped running end-to-end. We can obtain better results if, for each illustration page, we generate many outputs and pick the best one. 

##1. Further Explorations
###1. Going beyond existing stories
We tried out using ChatGPT for novel stories and it seems to work pretty well. We share our results for the following prompt:
```
You are a storyteller. 
Generate a adventure story about a protagonist Aspen the dog that takes place at H-Mart. 
There should be conflict and a twist in the story, as well as a resolution at the end. 
The story should be exactly ten sentences. 
Show me the sentences as a numbered list. 
For each sentence, generate a prompt for a text-to-image model.
```

####1. Story
```
Aspen the dog loved going on adventures with his owner, and today they were headed to H-Mart for some shopping.
Prompt: Aspen and his owner walking towards H-Mart with a shopping cart.

Once inside, Aspen's nose went wild with all the delicious scents, and he led his owner down each aisle.
Prompt: Aspen, standing on his hind legs, sniffing the air in front of the shelves stocked with food and treats.

Suddenly, Aspen caught a whiff of something strange and started barking furiously at one of the aisles.
Prompt: Aspen, barking at an aisle in H-Mart, with his owner trying to calm him down.

His owner thought Aspen was just being silly, but Aspen knew something was wrong.
Prompt: Aspen, looking determined and focused, while his owner looks skeptical.

Aspen's instincts were proven right when they stumbled upon a group of thieves trying to rob the store.
Prompt: Aspen, standing in front of a group of thieves, growling and barking, while his owner stands behind him in shock.

The thieves were startled by Aspen's sudden appearance and fled the store, but not before grabbing Aspen and running away with him.
Prompt: Aspen, being grabbed by the thieves and taken out of the store, with his owner running after them in desperation.

Aspen was scared and alone, but he refused to give up hope. He chewed through the ropes that bound him and escaped from his captors.
Prompt: Aspen, chewing through the ropes that bound him, while the thieves are distracted.

Aspen ran as fast as he could until he found his way back to H-Mart, where he reunited with his owner.
Prompt: Aspen and his owner, hugging each other tightly in front of H-Mart, with shoppers looking on.

Aspen's bravery had saved the day, and the grateful store manager rewarded him with a lifetime supply of dog treats.
Prompt: Aspen, surrounded by bags of dog treats, with his owner and the store manager looking on with gratitude.

Aspen and his owner left H-Mart, proud of their adventure and grateful for the loyal and courageous dog by their side.
Prompt: Aspen and his owner walking away from H-Mart, with Aspen carrying a big bag of dog treats and his owner looking at him with pride.

###1. Multiple characters
While we did not have time for this project, we hope to try out multiple character customization in the future. This can be done naively by training multiple tokens for Textual Inversion or finetuning sequentially on Dreambooth. However, these naive methods are reported to not work very well and perhaps something like [3] could be explored.
